# Challenge #1: Horiseon-refractor

This is a repo to hold refractory code for Horiseon making the website more accessible to web browsers on smaller devices. 

## Description

- The motivation behind the project was to be able to implement some of the new skills I have developed as a beginner coder so that I can practice meeting accessibility standards. 
- I modified this project to practice refractoring. In doing so, I was able to allow the website to be more accessible, ensuring that people with disabilities can access the website and still be able to navigate the site and gain the same information as other individuals navigating the site. Additionally I was able to ensure all bugs in the code were fixed.
- Modifying this code addressed the websites link bug associated with the SEO nav link. Additionally, it solved the websites lack of accessibility to those not capable of seeing the images on the page and knowing how they compliment the page. 
- In modifying this project, I learned how to address semantic structure more appropriately than I did before and improved some of my naming conventions for coding.
